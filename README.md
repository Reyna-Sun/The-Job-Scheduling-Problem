Abstract—The Job Shop Scheduling is a NP- hard optimization problems researched, with the purpose to find an optimal sequences according number of jobs and number of machines. Additionally,  the objective of the function is to minimize the maximum time in the process of  jobs, this is known as Makespan. Over the years, it has been worked in the application of various optimization algorithms,  based on heuristics and metaheuristics, however the two most popular has been Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. Highlighting, the importance of the job scheduling problem due to help in the solution of activities in industries, where are involved processes of jobs and machines, helping to the production .
Keywords—JSSP,  Jobs, Machines, Greedy Algorithm, Genetic algorithm, sequence, optimal solution, makespan.
